                Click into the minefield to expose free space. <br>
            The numbers show how many bombs are adjacent to that square. <br>
        
                Use your math skills and powers of deduction to <br>
                    identify where the bombs live. <br>
             Right-click to place a flag where you think a bomb may be.  <br>
                A flag will prevent you from accidentally sploding a bomb. <br>
                The game ends when you have opened all empty squares or <br>
                                        have tripped a bomb. <br>

                                            or you die. <br>
